# Invites
### What is Invites? What does it do?
Invites is a small, easy to use cog for tracking which invites members use to join!

- Upon loading, assigns `Bot.invites`, `Bot.get_invite()`, and `Bot.wait_for_invites()`
    - Noted to reduce conflicts for developers utilising bot variables

- Requirements
    - discord.py 1.5.0+
    - GUILDS, SERVER_MEMBERS and INVITES intents
    - `manage_guild` and `manage_channels` permissions
